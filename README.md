# Team 9's Code for Good Project

Non-profit: Future Ready Five

### Our Challenge
We intended to tackle the issue of student retention and reliance on parent involvement in ages 0-5 intervention programs.
### Our Solution
We "game-ified" the process of intervention for students, while making it easy for parents to support their children's education and for providers to integrate with our platform. 
### Team Member Acknowledgements
